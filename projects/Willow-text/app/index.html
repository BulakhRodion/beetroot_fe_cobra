        	This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling.
	        About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo
	        encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to
	        clear the way with its cow–catcher; but the mass of animals was too
	        great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now
	        and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them,
	        for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and
	        change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could
			contain.
        </p>

			The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the
	        platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a
	        hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should
	        please the buffaloes to get out of the way. Passepartout was furious at
	        the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of
			revolvers upon them.

			"What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the
	        trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were not impeding
	        travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap
	        in his programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the
			locomotive into this herd of beasts!"
